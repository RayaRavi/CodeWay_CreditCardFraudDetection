# Credit Card Fraud Detection Details:
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project repository. This project is dedicated to developing a robust model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset employed here is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset, which contains information about various credit card transactions, including features such as transaction amount, time, and other relevant parameters.
The primary objective of this project is to build an effective classification model capable of accurately distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. 
To achieve this goal, we experiment with a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. 
By leveraging these algorithms, we aim to identify patterns and anomalies within the transaction data that signify potential fraudulent activity.

# Key Features:
